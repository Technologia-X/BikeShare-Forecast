# Forecasting the Net Rate of Bike Renting for a Given Station at a Given Hour


### Objective
There are a total of 3 data files for this task. Station data, trip data and weather data. Station data contains the ID, name, coordinates, dock count, and the city of every station. Weather data contains the temperature, dew point, humidity, Zip code, and other information about the weather on every single day from 1/09/2014 to 31/08/2015 for every city the stations are located in. Finally, the trip data contains the the date, time, and station ID that every trip has started from or ended at. The main objective of this task is to be able to forecast the net rate of bike renting at a given station at a given hour where net rate is defined as the total number of trips ended minus the total number of trips started at a station.

### Result
 In this task, we have done some data analysis to determine which variables are to be used to achieve the objective. The result of forecasting an hour ahead for station with ID 70 can be visualized using the graph below. The red lines are the forecasted values while the blue lines are the true value.
